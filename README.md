# Loom Button

[Loom](https://loom.com) allows users to record their screen, camera, or both at the same time.

The Loom Button brings Loomâ€™s recording capabilities directly to your Moodle site's Atto editor -- no user install (or even user account!) is required for your users to create video content.

Implementation requires you to sign up for a Public App ID through the [Loom Developer Portal](https://www.loom.com/developer-portal).

# Features

* Instant editing of a Loom
* Custom descriptions with timestamps
* Video and GIF embedding (with [Loom Embed plugin](https://github.com/maccmaxitrc/moodle-filter_loom))
* Transcripts
* Custom theming
* All other current and future Loom functionality

For more information on features and limitations, visit the [Loom Developer Documentation](https://dev.loom.com/docs/record-sdk/sdk-standard)
